First very little project using Love2D framework, programming in LUA.

Moving object through space,
collisions with other objects,
score.

Move a little space ship in 8 directions, when encounter static enemy, enemy disappear and reappear with other coordinates in the window.
Each time the enemy (static) is caught, the score is updated (+1)
